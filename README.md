How are you feeling?

People are always around us. But how are they feeling?

We at Feely believe the best way to answer this question is to first ask yourself, how are you feeling?

Because we are all a lot more similar to each other than we often are willing to believe.

Disprove your inhibitions. Connect to that other. Be one with those around you.

Feely, always.

### WHAT IT IS: 

A solution to the paradox that is the serene connectivity of our world juxtaposed with the sheer detachment of real, genuine interaction. 

### WHAT IT DOES: 

Simply, Feely allows you to express your emotion, viscerally and anonymously, so that you might get a little more in touch with yourself, so that in the long run, you might connect better with those around you. 

### HOW TO USE IT: 

It's easy: just visit the homepage and choose a color that fits your mood, desires or just general state of mind. Don't think too much about it; just do it. Then you will be prompted for a short description of how you are feeling. This begins the correlation that is the relationship between colors and emotions ... On the main feed, you will see just this: some people might have chosen the same color as you, many most likely will not. 

But this is where things become really interesting: click on a color of your choosing. You might just be suprised how your interpretation of a color might be different than someone elses: I see orange as passionate and motivating, perhaps you as hot and overwhelming. 

We are all in our own way unique. But perhaps in the end we are not that different.

Let us see then. 

Don't think. Just do.

Feely.
